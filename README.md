This is a ten player simultaneous chess game. It's written in Haxe using [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel) targetting HTML5. The server is written in Python 3 using [Autobahn](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython). 

This still needs a lot of testing but should be somewhat playable considering there is no win logic yet. I, so far, have only tested this using Chromium. Client needs a lot of refactoring, particularly in the determineMoves method. 

I'll update with instructions as well as a test server and link to the compiled JavaScript once I figure out how to get everything set up again from scratch.
